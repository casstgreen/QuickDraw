    manage the different parts

Sat Dec 16 13:48:36 2017 - One thing we should do is switch up the class definitions
    a bit so that they we define the __init__() method for class constructors

    This makes it so that we can have multiple gun objects for instance) that have 
        their own values for cost, rarity, etc. instead of all guns sharing the same 
        cost variable.

    I did this for the gun class. Also, having the list of parameters with assignments
        in the parentheses of the __init__ function (aka the constructor) gives
        them default values, so
             if GunClass() is called, a gun with default values is made.
             if GunClass(20, "rare", "shotgun", 25, 20, 10, "draw", "

    see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html, especially starting at 
        "9.3.5. Class and Instance Variables"

    GunClass since those already stand for other things in Python
